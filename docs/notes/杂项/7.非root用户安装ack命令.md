# 非root用户安装ack命令

### Install the ack executable

If you don't have the root permission, you can do as follows:

```
curl https://beyondgrep.com/ack-2.22-single-file > ~/bin/ack && chmod 0755 !#:3
```

### Add `ack` to PATH

```bash
# vim ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```

##### View your PATH

Sometimes, you may wish to install programs into other locations on your computer, but be able to execute them easily without specifying their exact location. You can do this easily by adding a directory to your **$PATH**. To see what's in your **$PATH** right now, type this into a terminal:

```
echo $PATH
```

You'll probably see the directories mentioned above, as well as perhaps some others, and they are all separated by colons. Now let's add another directory to the list.

##### Set your PATH

Let's say you wrote a little shell script called **hello.sh** and have it located in a directory called **/place/with/the/file**. This script provides some useful function to all of the files in your current directory, that you'd like to be able to execute no matter what directory you're in.

Simply add **/place/with/the/file** to the **$PATH** variable with the following command:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/place/with/the/file
```

You should now be able to execute the script anywhere on your system by just typing in its name, without having to include the full path as you type it.
